# dbs-assessment for Dependency injection framework

The following are the benefits of the dependency injection or inversion of control.

> Separation of Concerns. 
> Boilerplate Code reduction in application classes because all work to initialize dependencies is handled by the injector component. 
> Configurable components makes application easily extendable. 
> Unit testing is easy with mock objects. 

The class MyMessageDITest is the main class to test the behaviour of singleton and prototype dependency injection.
